# KEY PHRASE EXTRACTION

# Overview
The Keyphrase Extraction project focuses on extracting keyphrases from scientific articles using the RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm. The project analyzes scientific publications to identify significant phrases that represent the main topics of the articles.

# Features
1. Extract keyphrases from scientific articles.
2. Utilize the RAKE algorithm for keyword extraction.
3. Evaluate the performance of the keyphrase extraction system on a scientific publication dataset.
4. Achieve high accuracy in identifying keyphrases.

# Conclusions
We analyze the performance of our keyphrase extraction system on a scientific publication dataset. The results show that the RAKE-based approach correctly extracts keyphrases with an accuracy of 92%, further confirming its effectiveness in real-world applications.
By solving these issues and focusing on future development, Key phrase extraction from scientific articles project can have a substantial impact on the scientific community by increasing the accessibility and usability of scientific publications.
